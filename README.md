# HelloWeb
A new way of Teaching the Web with Artificial Intelligence System
Personality and GUI Development are under process, GUI representaion looks like Dora The Explorer. 
We developed an interactive teaching tool to teach absolute beginners about HTML basics.
Voice inetraction is used to make it more user friendly moreover artificial intelligence is adding a bit more of comfort in the learning process.
Each and every part of HTML coding are to be explained graphically in order to make the tutorial visually intresting for the learner, "A picture speaks more than words".

#Start
command: 
```
python DoraTheExplorer.py || python3 DoraTheExplorer.py
```
Tutorial begins after saying this phrase "teach me web"
later you'd need to register yourself by simply telling your name to the AI

#Script
Code written in Python 3.5
In linux system change the speech engine to espeak, read the documentaion http://espeak.sourceforge.net/docindex.html
Google gTTS voice recognization is used, you can use CMU-Sphinx as well refer to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/

#Usage

It can teach the basics of html to absolute beginners.
We are using the example of human body to explain the parts in HTML.
The HTML is compared with the human body,head with /head,body with /body,CSS with dresses and JS with makeup and grooming.
It can easily teach beginners in an attractive interactive way.
We designed it in such a way that even if a kid is trying to learn the HTML belongings, HE/SHE will learn it without losing intrest about the same. Training modules for JavaScript, PHP can also be added to this.

#Installation

run this command in shell
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
